        stack.append(i)
    elif i in ')}]':
        if not stack:
            is_good = False
            break
        open_bracket = stack.pop()
        if open_bracket == '(' and i == ')':
            continue
        if open_bracket == '{' and i == '}':
            continue
        if open_bracket == '[' and i == ']':
            continue
